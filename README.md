# neural fpga (working code is in weightFactory)
### next steps are applying it to the fpga and creating seperate files for each class 

This project implements a basic neural network with multiple layers in C++. The network reads data from a CSV file, applies weights and biases to inputs using the sigmoid activation function, and processes multiple layers to produce an output.

### Features
#### CSV Parsing: Reads weights and biases from a CSV file.
#### Neural Network Layers: Implements multiple layers, each with weights and biases, and applies the sigmoid activation function.
#### Layer Processing: Computes outputs based on provided inputs.
#### Classification: Chooses the best possible outcome from the computed results.
